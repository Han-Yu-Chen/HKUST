\section{Summary of the key findings}
\subsection{GXY}
The article first introduces the design model of HMIMO. The article uses two classifications, namely power-based and hardware-based, with two subclasses under each classification. 

Under the classification of power consumption, active HMIMO, also known as LIS, refers to the integration of a very large number of available software-programmable antenna software on an area-constrained surface, thus enabling signal transmission on this plane. Passive HMIMO, also known as RIS or IRS, does not require a dedicated power supply but is powered by its collection module and is, therefore, less costly. The highlight of this technology is the high efficiency of the transmitted signal and the simplicity of the signal processing.

Another way to classify HMIMO is based on the hardware construction, which divides HMIMO into continuous HMIMO and discrete HMIMO. before the article introduces the continuous HMIMO model, it first briefly explains the principle of holography in optics. By extension from the holographic concept, the so-called continuous HMIMO is the integration of numerous elements to form a continuous transceiver aperture in a finite plane.

The holographic MIMO completes the training by receiving a mixture of waves formed from the object reflected wave and the reference wave. In the subsequent communication process, the replica of reference wave is received, and the recovered wave beam is output.
Discrete MIMO, on the other hand, has a fundamentally different structure, consisting of discrete elements that can be modulated, not an array of antennas.

After presenting the design model, the article summarizes the fabrication method for making HMIMO. There are many fabrication techniques, which can be classified into two categories, continuous aperture based and discrete aperture based. With the continuous aperture, the holographic principle is used to form a beam wave. The discrete aperture-based fabrication method is based on the software-defined super surface antenna. The subsection concludes with a brief introduction of two companies that have started to experiment with the manufacturing of HMIMO.

The last subsection of this chapter describes the four modes of operation of HMIMO, while two modes are described in detail. As mentioned above, continuous HMIMOS as active transceivers is a beam technology formed by antennas based on holographic theory. Whereas discrete HMIMOS as passive reflectors is composed of reconfigurable elements. Because it is simpler, much of the work is now done by the latter.

\subsection{XQW}
This part lists four common functions, six properties, and six communication applications, most of which are related to the 6G wireless system expectations. The author uses concise statements and diagrams to help readers understand what he mentions.

HMIMOS can support a wide range of electromagnetic interactions and they are EM Field Polarization, EM Field Redirection, Pencile-like Beamforming, and EM Field Absorption. And Fig. 2 gives us an intuitive form of these four functions.

Then the author summarizes core differences in properties among HMIMOS systems, massive MIMO, and conventional multi-antenna relaying systems. 

Thirdly, he uses Figure. 3 to give us a good illustration of six wireless communication applications for outdoor and indoor environments.

Lastly, the author uses a table to list some recent work on different combinations between the functions, features, and communication applications of HMIMOS.

\subsection{ZY}
HMIMOS-based wireless communication systems differ from multi-antenna transceiver-based classical communications in its properties. Wireless communication systems employing HMIMOS anticipate being able to alter electromagnetic wave propagation since traditional communication systems are unable to control the wireless environment in which they operate. HMIMOS is a nearly continuous aperture that uses metamaterials and/or reconfigurable, subwavelength-spaced antennas. In addition to providing for the most flexibility and accuracy in impact field recording and manipulation, these surfaces with dense electromagnetic (EM) excitation components also use less power and cost, making it possible to efficiently shape arbitrary EM waves. Holographic imaging-grade wireless communication is now possible because of HMIMOS's strong EM processing capabilities. However, to accomplish HMIMOS-assisted communication, this necessitates novel signal processing algorithms and network schemes, as well as new mathematical techniques for characterizing the physical channel and analyzing the ultimate capacity gain.

HMIMOS-based communication systems are faced with the potentially very big MIMO channel estimate difficulty as a result of the limitations of the current HMIMOS hardware architectures. Two solutions are outlined in the article. An strategy that is frequently used is to train all of the HMIMOS unit elements for a considerable amount of time using pilots that are mostly provided by the base station and received at the user equipment via common reflections. One is to use an all-digital or hybrid analog and digital transceiver architecture, taught with a lot of data through compressed sensing and deep learning, to estimate the channel and create the phase matrix. Hardware complexity, higher power consumption, and training costs are drawbacks.

As the HMIMOS unit cell is built of metamaterials and is subject to strict tuning limits, it is challenging to integrate environmental awareness into HMIMOS-based communication systems. Solving non-convex design optimization issues is necessary for HMIMOS design. With high-fidelity beams and efficient radio management, smart holographic beamforming for continuous HMIMOS enables the intelligent location and tracking of solitary or small groups of devices. However, there are currently no self-optimizing holographic beamforming methods that make use of intricate aperture combining and low-level modulation.

The centralized configuration of HMIMOS necessitates the transmission of control information from various multi-antenna base stations, HMIMOS, and users (with one or more antennas per user) to the central controller, which presents issues with huge calculation and high energy consumption. To improve user scheduling, HMIMOS configuration, resource allocation, and beamforming, distributed algorithms must be created.


% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the 
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3. 

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\section{A detailed description of the results and their significance}
The article introduces the application of HMIMO systems in different scenarios, and shows that HMIMO has obvious gains for existing wireless communication systems in indoor and outdoor environments. In order to further elaborate, the paper selects two use cases from HMIMO applications in indoor and outdoor environments to analyze and introduce.
\subsection{High Accurate Indoor Positioning}
The paper analyzes the performance of the active continuous HMIMOS application for indoor positioning, mainly based on the study by S. Hu et al\cite{b1}. In \cite{b1}, the potential of LIS for positional has been scientifically demonstrated. Specifically, S. Hu first showed the CRLB expression when the target, with coordinates ($0,0,z_0$), was located on the LIS's central perpendicular line (CPL). In the derivation, the parameter $\tau$:
\begin{equation}
\tau=(R/z_0)^2\label{eq}
\end{equation}
which is the surface-area normalization parameter mentioned in this paper, has been introduced and will also be the transverse coordinate of the final distribution function in Fig.\ref{fig1}. The CRLB approximation for non-CPL targets is further derived according to the conclusion for CPL targets. The Cartesian distribution of the CRLB of the location information has been soon derived. However, in the practical application scenario, the measurement of the system will not be as ideal as the theory, so S. Hu introduced an unknown vector $\varphi$ to represent the amount of distortion based on the ideal one. As derived in \cite{b1}, this paper quoted the modeling results of CRLB for $z$-dimension with unknown $\varphi$. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.5\textwidth]{fig1.png}}
\caption{CRLBs of positioning with an active HMIMOS of a radius R for the case where a single user is located $z = 4m$ away from the center of surface. The wavelength $\lambda$ is 0.1m, and t represents the normalized surface area}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

In addition, the CRLB is the minimum lower bound used in statistics to represent the variance of an unbiased estimator. Under a deterministic model, the variance of the estimate about the location will never be smaller than its CRLB, whatever estimation method is used, which means that the variance of the location estimate can only be close to the CRLB. The closer it is to the CRLB, the better the possible localization of the system. In Fig.\ref{fig1}, it concludes that the larger the $\tau$, the greater the localization potential of the system. When the distance between two adjacent antenna elements is $\lambda/2$, the total number of antennas elements$N$ in the surface-area $\pi R^{2} $ can be donated as:
\begin{equation}
N=\frac{4\pi R^{2} }{\lambda^{2} } = \frac{4\pi \tau z_0^{2} }{\lambda^{2} }\label{eq}
\end{equation}
The N of a typical traditional massive-MIMO array is 200, so the $\tau \approx 0.01$. However, LIS typically has a larger N, which means larger $\tau$. Therefore, corresponding to the CRLB results in Fig.\ref{fig1}, HMIMO used for positional has better performance.

\subsection{Maximize Energy Efficiency (EE)}
Improving EE has been one of the great interest issues in the field of communication. The paper talks about the contribution of HMIMO to EE maximization in the application section, then the performance analysis of HMIMO for EE maximization could be very attractive. Its performance results listed in the paper are mainly from the study of C. Huang et al\cite{b2}. In \cite{b2}, C. Huang proposed two RIS-based EE maximization algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on the gradient descent method to obtain the RIS phase coefficients, and then used the fractional programming to optimize the distribution of transmit power.
    \item Based on sequential fraction programming to optimize the RIS phase shifts directly.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.5\textwidth]{fig2.png}}
\caption{Average EE with HMIMOS-assisted communication versus the maximum BS transmit power $P_{max}$ in $dBm$}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}
The performance analysis of this case in this paper reproduces algorithms proposed in \cite{b2}. The authors of this paper analyze and compare the results following the approach of \cite{b2}. Although this paper takes different values for the parameters $K$, $M$, $N$ from \cite{b2}, the conclusions are the same. $K$ measures users in the RIS-based communication scenario, $M$ measures the antenna base stations, and $N$ measures the element intelligent surface. As shown in Fig.\ref{fig2}, algorithms based on RIS significantly improve the EE with a gain of almost 200\% compared to the conventional AF relay. At the same time, this paper also points out that EE increases after $P_{max}$ reaches 32$dBm$, which instead causes a decrease in EE. This has been explained in \cite{b2}, EE is not infinitely increasing with $P_{max}$, EE is finite. EE will not increase again after reaching its maximum value. Therefore the excess 32$dBm$ of $P_{max}$ is not available to increase EE.

\section{COMMENTS}

For this part, I was looking forward to seeing the combination of HMIMO and 6G wireless networks, but after reading it, I found that the author didn't cover a lot of 6G. 
For example, there are only attributes of HMIMO listed in this part. Readers couldn’t see the contrast between HMIMO and massive MIMO and conventional multi-antenna relaying systems in a straightforward way. As a consequence, readers are supposed to consult relevant materials to understand the requirements of 6G and some basic knowledge of traditional MIMO, or readers themselves have a certain reserve of communication knowledge about the MIMO system.

This part is quite subtle since the author uses some serial numbers such as F1, C1, A1, A2, and so on to represent the functions, characteristics, and applications respectively. And at the end of this part, he combines the three parts together and summarizes some recent works using the serial numbers to make the table. And each concept in the table was interpreted in the previous article. So it’s really much easier for readers to understand these works. And this gives scholars a good index of HMIMOS-based wireless communication systems.
